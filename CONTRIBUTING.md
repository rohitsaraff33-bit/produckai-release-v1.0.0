## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Backend (FastAPI)

**File structure:**

```
apps/api/
├── api/               # API routes
│   ├── themes.py     # /themes endpoints
│   ├── feedback.py   # /feedback endpoints
│   └── ...
├── services/          # Business logic
│   ├── clustering.py # Clustering pipeline
│   ├── insights.py   # Insight generation
│   └── ...
├── models/            # SQLAlchemy models
├── config.py          # Configuration
└── main.py            # FastAPI app
```

**Best practices:**

- Use Pydantic for request/response models
- Keep routes thin, logic in services
- Type hints everywhere (`mypy` enforced)
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Structured logging with `structlog`

### Frontend (Next.js)

**File structure:**

```
apps/web/
├── app/               # App Router pages
│   ├── page.tsx      # Home page
│   ├── themes/       # /themes pages
│   └── ...
├── components/        # React components
├── lib/               # Utilities
└── types/             # TypeScript types
```

**Best practices:**

- Use TypeScript for all files
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Server components by default
- Client components only when needed (`"use client"`)
- Fetch data in Server Components or RSC

### Database Migrations

```bash
# Create migration after model changes
make migrate-create MSG="add sentiment column to feedback"

# Review migration file in infra/alembic/versions/

# Apply migration
make migrate
```

### Adding New Integrations

1. Create connector in `apps/api/services/ingestion/extractors/`
2. Implement `BaseExtractor` interface
3. Add demo data in `samples/`
4. Add tests in `apps/api/tests/`
5. Update `.env.example` with required env vars
6. Add documentation in README and INSTALLATION.md

**Example:**

```python
# apps/api/services/ingestion/extractors/linear.py
from .base import BaseExtractor, IngestionResult

class LinearExtractor(BaseExtractor):
    async def extract(self) -> IngestionResult:
        # Implementation
        pass
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

```python
# apps/api/tests/test_scoring.py
def test_calculate_theme_score():
    score = calculate_theme_score(
        frequency=10,
        acv=50000,
        sentiment=-0.5,
        segment="enterprise"
    )
    assert 0 <= score <= 100
```

### Integration Tests

```python
# apps/api/tests/test_api.py
async def test_create_feedback(client):
    response = await client.post("/feedback", json={
        "text": "Need SSO support",
        "customer_name": "Acme Corp",
        "source": "slack"
    })
    assert response.status_code == 201
```

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
docker compose exec api pytest apps/api/tests/test_scoring.py

# Run specific test
docker compose exec api pytest apps/api/tests/test_scoring.py::test_calculate_theme_score

# Run with verbose output
docker compose exec api pytest -v
```
