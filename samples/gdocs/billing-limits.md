# Billing & Usage Limits Improvement Proposal

## Problem Statement

We're receiving consistent feedback about billing surprises and lack of usage visibility. This is causing customer frustration and churn risk, particularly in our SMB and MM segments.

## Current Issues

### 1. Unexpected Overages

Customers report being surprised by overage charges:

- No proactive alerts when approaching limits
- Bill shock at end of month
- Unclear what counts toward usage
- No self-service way to check current usage

### 2. Rigid Plan Limits

Current tiering doesn't match customer needs:

- Large gap between Starter (5 users) and Pro (25 users)
- Storage limits too restrictive for media-heavy workflows
- API rate limits blocking integrations
- All-or-nothing feature access

### 3. Poor Usage Visibility

Dashboard lacks key information:

- No real-time usage metrics
- Can't see historical trends
- Team admins can't monitor per-user usage
- No forecasting or projections

## Customer Feedback Summary

**SmallBiz LLC** (SMB, $8K ACV):

> "We got hit with a $400 overage charge last month. Had no idea we were over our API limit until the bill came. Almost canceled our account."

**TechStart Inc** (MM, $45K ACV):

> "We need something between 5 and 25 users. We have 12 people who need access but can't justify Pro pricing for features we don't use."

**Acme Corp** (ENT, $120K ACV):

> "Our team leads need visibility into usage by department for budget allocation. Current dashboard shows nothing."

## Proposed Solutions

### A. Usage Alerts & Monitoring

Implement proactive notification system:

- Email alerts at 50%, 75%, 90% of limit
- In-app notifications with usage bars
- Slack/Teams webhook integrations
- Real-time dashboard widget

### B. Flexible Plan Options

Introduce more granular plans:

- **Pay-as-you-go option** for SMB customers
  - Base fee + per-unit pricing
  - Monthly spending caps

- **Flexible seats** between tiers
  - $20/user add-ons for Starter plan
  - Avoid forcing plan upgrades for +1 user

- **À la carte features**
  - Unlock specific features without full tier upgrade
  - Examples: SSO, advanced analytics, extra storage

### C. Enhanced Usage Dashboard

Build comprehensive usage page:

- Current period usage vs. limits
- Historical trends (3-6-12 month views)
- Per-user/per-team breakdowns
- Overage projections based on trends
- Export usage data (CSV)

### D. Billing Controls

Give customers more control:

- Set hard spending caps (block overages)
- Choose between overage or service degradation
- Billing frequency options (monthly/annual)
- Invoice customization for enterprise (PO numbers, custom fields)

## Technical Requirements

- Usage tracking service (real-time counters)
- Notification service integration
- Billing system API updates
- New UI components for usage dashboard
- Database schema updates for granular tracking

## Success Metrics

- Reduce billing-related support tickets by 50%
- Decrease churn from billing issues by 30%
- Increase upgrade rate by showing value of higher tiers
- > 80% of customers opt-in to usage alerts

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (4 weeks): Usage alerts + basic dashboard
- Phase 2 (6 weeks): Flexible plan options + billing controls
- Phase 3 (8 weeks): Advanced dashboard with forecasting

## Open Questions

1. Should we grandfather existing customers into new pricing?
2. What's the right threshold for overage alerts (50%? 60%)?
3. Do we need webhook APIs for custom integrations?
4. Should usage data be available via public API?

## Appendix: Competitive Analysis

- **Competitor A**: Real-time usage dashboard, alerts at 80/90/100%
- **Competitor B**: Pay-as-you-go model with $50 monthly minimum
- **Competitor C**: Flexible seat add-ons, hard spending caps available

## Next Steps

- Validate with 5-10 customer interviews
- Create detailed technical design
- Pricing team to model revenue impact
- Legal review of billing terms changes
