# Authentication & Authorization Spec

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication and authorization requirements for our SaaS platform based on customer feedback and enterprise needs.

## Background

Multiple enterprise customers (Acme Corp, Enterprise Solutions) have requested enhanced authentication options beyond basic username/password. Key pain points include:

- Lack of SSO support forcing manual credential management
- No SAML integration for enterprise identity providers
- Missing role-based access control (RBAC) for team management
- Audit logging gaps for compliance requirements

## Requirements

### 1. Single Sign-On (SSO) Support

Enterprise customers need SSO integration with their existing identity providers:

- **SAML 2.0 support** - Required for Enterprise tier
  - Support for Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, Google Workspace
  - Service Provider (SP) initiated and IdP initiated flows
  - Automatic user provisioning and de-provisioning

- **OAuth 2.0 / OIDC** - For mid-market customers
  - Google, Microsoft, GitHub providers
  - Automatic account linking

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Required for all paid tiers:

- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) via authenticator apps
- SMS backup codes
- Admin enforcement capabilities
- Grace period for MFA rollout

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

Granular permissions system:

- **Pre-defined roles:**
  - Owner - Full admin access
  - Admin - User management, billing
  - Member - Standard user access
  - Viewer - Read-only access

- **Custom roles** (Enterprise only)
  - Fine-grained permissions
  - Resource-level access control

### 4. Session Management

- Configurable session timeouts (15 min to 24 hours)
- Force logout on password change
- Device trust management
- Concurrent session limits

### 5. Audit Logging

Compliance requirement for Enterprise customers:

- Log all authentication events
- Track permission changes
- Export capabilities (CSV, JSON)
- 90-day retention minimum (1 year for Enterprise)

## Customer Quotes

> "We can't roll out your platform company-wide without SAML SSO. Our IT security policy requires centralized identity management."
> — Security Lead, Acme Corp ($120K ACV)

> "The lack of MFA is a blocker for us. We need 2FA for all users accessing customer data."
> — CTO, Enterprise Solutions ($250K ACV)

> "We love the product but need granular permissions. Not everyone should see billing info."
> — Product Manager, MidCo Industries ($60K ACV)

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1 (Q1)

- Implement SAML 2.0 SP
- Add TOTP MFA
- Basic RBAC with 4 predefined roles

### Phase 2 (Q2)

- OAuth/OIDC providers
- Custom roles for Enterprise
- Enhanced audit logging

## Success Metrics

- 80%+ Enterprise customer adoption of SSO
- <5% support tickets related to authentication
- Meet SOC 2 audit requirements for access control

## Open Questions

1. Should we support hardware security keys (YubiKey, etc.)?
2. Pricing impact - bundle MFA with all paid tiers or Enterprise only?
3. Self-service SAML configuration vs white-glove setup?

## Next Steps

- Create detailed technical design
- Estimate engineering effort (targeting 1-2 sprints for Phase 1)
- Schedule review with Security & Compliance teams
- Draft customer communication plan
